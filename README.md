# Knucklebones

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This is a solo game project made by a student of Prime Digital Academy. Knucklebones is a game of risk versus reward, where the choice to focus on attacking the opponent or building up your own score is the main focus of the game.

The game is a mix of luck and skill, where luck may give you an edge, but cunning skill and strategy can leave unsuspecting players far behind.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. (Thank your people)

Thanks to [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/) as inspiration for the creation of this game. Knucklebones is a minigame within Cult of the Lamb, however it is missing the essence of a second player. I hoped to create that essence of a local board game with this project.
