# Knucklebones

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This is a solo game project made by a student of Prime Digital Academy. Knucklebones is a game of risk versus reward, where the choice to focus on attacking the opponent or building up your own score is the main focus of the game.

The game is a mix of luck and skill, where luck may give you an edge, but cunning skill and strategy can leave unsuspecting players far behind.
